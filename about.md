## Further information

This Shiny app is a re-engineered version of the [Syria Regional Refugee Response Portal](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php) originally provided by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) based on [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Shiny](http://http://shiny.rstudio.com/), and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

It uses up-to-date R technology and R packages which are not yet available on CRAN like, for instance, Hadley Wickham's [tidyr package](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) or Joe Cheng's [leaflet package](https://github.com/jcheng5/leaflet-shiny).

Most of the heavy lifting is done by functions defined in utils.R which is also included in the app's repo. Part of this functionality is the following:

* Downloading data using the United Nations JSON API
* Tidying and processing the data
* Creating the pyramid plot for visualizing demographic data

## Source Code

The app's repo can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/alex23lemm/Syria-Refugee-Response-Shiny-App). In addition, you may want to check out the [project specific web page](http://alex23lemm.github.io/Syria-Refugee-Response-Shiny-App)(Also on GitHub).
